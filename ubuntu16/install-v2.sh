# This script differs from install-p4dev.sh as follows:

# install-p4dev.sh executes steps to build the behavioral-model
# simple_switch program, using only Thrift as the IPC mechanism for
# other processes to connect to it and make table add/modify/delete
# requests.

# install-p4dev-p4runtime.sh executes steps to build the
# behavioral-model simple_switch_grpc program, which uses the
# P4Runtime API as the IPC mechanism for other processes to connect to
# it and make table add/modify/delete requests.  It is built with the
# necessary options so that the simple_switch_grpc process _also_
# supports Thrift, but this is only intended as a debugging aid,
# e.g. to show table contents using the simple_switch_CLI program.

# Size of the largest 3 source trees, after being built on an x86_64
# machine, without documentation:
# grpc - 1.2G
# p4c - 1.6G
# behavioral-model - 4.1G

# Remember the current directory when the script was started:
