# In-Band Network Telemetry(INT) based task scheduling for edge computing
 This repository holds the P4 source code for data-plane programmable bmv2 switch that enables INT. Task scheduler leverages this telemetry information to make task scheduling decisions. Network topology is created in mininet that uses bmv2 switch.
